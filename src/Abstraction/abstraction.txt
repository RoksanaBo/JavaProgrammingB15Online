When we hear word abstract - its something that is not concrete.

Abstraction concept, concentrates on essentials or important things. It doesn't care about details.
In Java- not worrying about the details/implementation.
 Ex: Animals -not concrete, not specific,

 Abstraction- hiding the implementation details, and focusing on importance.

 abstract method- it does not have a body./ or without implementation details of method.
 it's a method that's meant to be override.

abstract- method that meant to be override. when we override the method,we can add different implementations.
this method cannot be private or final. Only instance method can be override and can be abstract.
This abstract method is very special.You cannot create abstract method in regular class.
It has some requirement. Abstract method can only be declared in abstract class or Interface.


Abstract class - abstract is something not concrete,
               - we cannot create object from it.
               - class meant to be extended.
               - abstract class cannot be final

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface- blue print of a class, but its not a class:
       public interface name{

       }
we can abstract methods in interface. and let classes implement abstract methods.



implements keyword - we use it to implement abstract methods to abstract class.


Interface meant to be implemented
Интерфейс должен быть реализован

Why do we need interface?
-a class can implement multiple interfaces.  класс может реализовывать несколько интерфейсов.
-a class can extend only one class.          класс может расширять только один класс.

Interface - contract between class and outside world.It provides set of abstract methods.

What we can have in Interface?
-abstract method.
-default method
-static method
we cannot have constructor.
