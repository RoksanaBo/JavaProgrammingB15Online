        // Method overloading is a feature that allows us
        // to have more than one method with the same name,
        // so long as we use different parameters

        // It is the ability to create multiple methods of
        // the same name with different implementations

        // Calls to overloaded method will run a specific
        // implementation of that method.

        // It improves code readability and re-usability
        // It is easier to remember one method name instead of
        // remembering multiple names.
        // Achieves consistency in naming. One name for methods that are
        // used for example println.

        // Overloaded methods give programmers the flexibility to call
        // a similar method with different types of data.
